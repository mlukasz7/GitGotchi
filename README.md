# GitGotchi

The goal of the project is to prepare gamification for GitHub. The idea is based on the iconic game Tamagotchi. Thanks to diligent work, our character is happy and fulfilled. Additionally, too much workload can signal a potential risk of burnout. Besides gamification, the platform can be expanded with additional features, which will be gradually added, creating a combination of gamification, development, and community engagement.
